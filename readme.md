## What is this?

I am adapting Wes Bos' Learn Node course for my own project, a spending tracker called Thrift.

To get started, run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
cd thrift
npm start
```

I keep track of where I am at in this project with a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/g7iGaI8T) that only I can access and I take notes on my progress in my [100-days-of-code GitHub repository](https://github.com/smwarsh/100-days-of-code). I take notes for my project in my handy dandy notebook.
